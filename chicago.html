        <p class="paragraph_descriptions">
          In the mid-18th century, the area was inhabited by a Native American tribe known as
          the Potawatomi, who had taken the place of the Miami and Sauk and Fox peoples.
          The first known non-indigenous permanent settler in Chicago was Jean Baptiste Point
          du Sable. Du Sable was of African and French descent and arrived in the 1780s.
